# Packer - File Management Utility

Packer is a versatile file management utility designed to facilitate the organized copying and moving of files based on their extensions while preserving the original folder hierarchy. Its primary purpose is to streamline the process of copying or moving specific file types from source folders, particularly in scenarios where these files coexist with project-related materials.

## **Use Cases:**

Imagine maintaining a consolidated workspace where your photo and audio editing projects reside side by side. With Packer, you can seamlessly extract only the exported images and sounds, leaving behind the original project files. This approach empowers you to transfer these files to another location while retaining the familiar folder structure, ensuring the preservation of your source files. Game developers, in particular, stand to benefit from this tool, as it optimizes resource organization and time efficiency.

## **Key Features:**

Packer boasts a range of features designed to enhance your file management experience:

* **Suffix Removal:** Easily eliminate suffixes from file names during copying or moving operations.

* **Extension Case Adjustment:** Maintain consistent extension casing across your projects. Packer offers the ability to convert extensions to upper or lower case, accommodating the varying conventions of different software.

* **Extension Case Insensitivity:** Packer enables seamless copying and moving of files, regardless of the case of their extensions. This feature eliminates the need to worry about matching the extension case precisely.
